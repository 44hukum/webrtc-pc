=== NOTA BENE ===
To generate the dated version of the specification:

* Open this document in Firefox.
* Press CTRL-ALT-SHIFT-S.
* Select "HMTL (source)" from dialog box.
* This will open a new tab with generated html. Copy and paste this to a new
file. Note if you use Chrome or Safari, this step will not work. What will
happen is the paste will have the original document, not what was displayed in
the window that you did the copy on.
* Create a new directory in archives correspoinding to the correct
day (YYYYMMDD)
* Copy the file and all associated resources (images/) into the newly created
archive directory.
* Search for and edit the links for "This version" and "Previous version". Add
the new file into git and check in.
* Once everyone is happy, the webrtc.html or getusermedia.html and the
corresponding archive folders can be copied to editor/ in the W3C CVS.
