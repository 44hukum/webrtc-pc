## WebRTC 1.0: Real-time Communication Between Browsers

This document defines a set of ECMAScript APIs in WebIDL to allow media to be
sent to and received from another browser or device implementing the appropriate
set of real-time protocols. This specification is being developed in conjunction
with a protocol specification developed by the IETF RTCWEB group and an API
specification to get access to local media devices developed by the Media
Capture Task Force.

### Published Versions

While we have taken measures to reduce the frequency of build breakages
(such as freezing respec-w3c-common at version 8.7.1), the tip-of-tree of
this document may contain work in progress changes and other inconsistencies,
including an incomplete change log. If you want to review something more coherent,
review the latest editors' draft; these are published at intervals on the order of weeks.
